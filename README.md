# DISCONTINUED!

as i no longer give a damn about plugin development, i have archived this repo and relicensed to WTFPL. feel free to do whatever you want with the code here (it sucks anyways)

Simple GTTOD BepInEx plugin that adds buttons to max out/reset aspects. 

As of right now, the buttons just reuse the "CONFIRM" sprite from the button they copy from -- the middle button maxes aspects, and the lower one resets them.
